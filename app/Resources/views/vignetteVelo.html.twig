        <h5>Description :</h5>
        <p class="desc">The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by Kirkpatrick
            MacMillan, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed. He is also associated with
            the first recorded instance of a cycling traffic offense, when a Glasgow newspaper in 1842 reported an
            accident in which an anonymous "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious
            design" knocked over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five The word bicycle first appeared in English
            print in The Daily News in 1868, to describe "Bysicles and trysicles" on the "Champs Elysées and Bois de
            Boulogne.</p>
